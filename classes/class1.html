      <h3>Lion</h3>
      <p>
        The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to
        Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short,
        rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail.
        It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and
        have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called
        prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females,
        and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly
        on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone
        predator. The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is
        usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it
        adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic
        period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast
        Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in
        sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been
        listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations
        in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s.
        Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas.
        Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss
        and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern. One of
        the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has
        been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national
        flags, and in literature and films. Lions have been kept in menageries
        since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought
        for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late
        18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient
        Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and
        medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range. Etymology
        The English word lion is derived via Anglo-Norman liun from Latin leōnem
        (nominative: leō), which in turn was a borrowing from Ancient Greek λέων
        léōn. The Hebrew word לָבִיא lavi may also be related.[4] The generic
        name Panthera is traceable to the classical Latin word 'panthēra' and
        the ancient Greek word πάνθηρ 'panther'.[5]

      <h3>Tiger</h3>
      <p title="information from wikipidea">
        The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus
        Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large
        head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical
        stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies,
        though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the
        island tigers of the Sunda Islands. Throughout the tiger's range, it
        inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and
        mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical
        and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and
        Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on
        ungulates, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and
        occupies home ranges, defending these from individuals of the same sex.
        The range of a male tiger overlaps with that of multiple females with
        whom he mates. Females give birth to usually two or three cubs that stay
        with their mother for about two years. When becoming independent, they
        leave their mother's home range and establish their own. Since the early
        20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic
        range and are locally extinct in West and Central Asia, in large areas
        of China and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger's range
        is severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List
        of Threatened Species, as its range is thought to have declined by 53%
        to 68% since the late 1990s. Major threats to tigers are habitat
        destruction and fragmentation due to deforestation, poaching for fur and
        the illegal trade of body parts for medicinal purposes. Tigers are also
        victims of human–wildlife conflict as they attack and prey on livestock
        in areas where natural prey is scarce. The tiger is legally protected in
        all range countries. National conservation measures consist of action
        plans, anti-poaching patrols and schemes for monitoring tiger
        populations. In several range countries, wildlife corridors have been
        established and tiger reintroduction is planned. The tiger is among the
        most popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It has been kept in
        captivity since ancient times and has been trained to perform in
        circuses and other entertainment shows. The tiger featured prominently
        in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its
        historic range and has continued to appear in culture worldwide.
        Etymology The Old English tigras derives from Old French tigre, from
        Latin tigris, which was a borrowing from tigris (Ancient Greek:
        τίγρις).[4] Since ancient times, the word tigris has been suggested to
        originate from the Armenian or Persian word for 'arrow', which may also
        be the origin of the name for the river Tigris.[5][6] However, today,
        the names are thought to be homonyms, and the connection between the
        tiger and the river is doubted.[6] Taxonomy In 1758, Carl Linnaeus
        described the tiger in his work Systema Naturae and gave it the
        scientific name Felis tigris, as the genus Felis was being used for all
        cats at the time. His scientific description was based on descriptions
        by earlier naturalists such as Conrad Gessner and Ulisse Aldrovandi.[2]
        In 1929, Reginald Innes Pocock placed the species in the genus Panthera
        using the scientific name Panthera tigris.[7][8] Subspecies Nine recent
        tiger subspecies have been proposed between the early 19th and early
        21st centuries, namely the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China,
        Siberian, Caspian, Javan, Bali and Sumatran tigers.[9][10] The validity
        of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999 as most putative
        subspecies were distinguished on the basis of fur length and
        colouration, striping patterns and body size of specimens in natural
        history museum collections that are not necessarily representative for
        the entire population. It was proposed to recognise only two tiger
        subspecies as valid, namely P. t. tigris in mainland Asia and the
        smaller P. t. sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands.[11] This
        two-subspecies proposal was reaffirmed in 2015 through a comprehensive
        analysis of morphological, ecological and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
        traits of all putative tiger subspecies.[10] In 2017, the Cat
        Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid
        taxonomy in accordance with the 2015 two-subspecies proposal and
        recognised only P. t. tigris and P. t. sondaica.[12] Results of a 2018
        whole-genome sequencing study of 32 samples from the six living putative
        subspecies—the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China, Siberian and
        Sumatran tiger—found them to be distinct and separate clades.[13] These
        results were corroborated in 2021 and 2023.[14][15] The Cat Specialist
        Group states that "Given the varied interpretations of data, the
        [subspecific] taxonomy of this species is currently under review by the
        IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group."[16]

      <p title="information from wikipidea">
        The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant cat species in
        the genus Panthera. It has a pale yellowish to dark golden fur with dark
        spots grouped in rosettes. Its body is slender and muscular reaching a
        length of 92–183 cm (36–72 in) with a 66–102 cm (26–40 in) long tail and
        a shoulder height of 60–70 cm (24–28 in). Males typically weigh 30.9–72
        kg (68–159 lb), and females 20.5–43 kg (45–95 lb). The leopard was first
        described in 1758, and several subspecies were proposed in the 19th and
        20th centuries. Today, eight subspecies are recognised in its wide range
        in Africa and Asia. It initially evolved in Africa during the Early
        Pleistocene, before migrating into Eurasia around the Early–Middle
        Pleistocene transition. Leopards were formerly present across Europe,
        but became extinct in the region at around the end of the Late
        Pleistocene-early Holocene. The leopard is adapted to a variety of
        habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe, including arid and montane
        areas. It is an opportunistic predator, hunting mostly ungulates and
        primates. It relies on its spotted pattern for camouflage as it stalks
        and ambushes its prey, which it sometimes drags up a tree. It is a
        solitary animal outside the mating season and when raising cubs. Females
        usually give birth to a litter of 2–4 cubs once in 15–24 months. Both
        male and female leopards typically reach sexual maturity at the age
        2–2.5 years. Listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, leopard
        populations are currently threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation,
        and are declining in large parts of the global range. Leopards have had
        cultural roles in Ancient Greece, West Africa and modern Western
        culture. Leopard skins are popular in fashion. Etymology The English
        name "leopard" comes from Old French leupart or Middle French liepart,
        that derives from Latin leopardus and ancient Greek λέοπάρδος
        (leopardos). Leopardos could be a compound of λέων (leōn), meaning
        'lion', and πάρδος (pardos), meaning 'spotted'.[3][4][5] The word
        λέοπάρδος originally referred to a cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus).[6]
        "Panther" is another common name, derived from Latin panther and ancient
        Greek πάνθηρ (pánthēr);[3] The generic name Panthera originates in Latin
        panthera, a hunting net for catching wild beasts to be used by the
        Romans in combats.[7] Pardus is the masculine singular form.[8] Taxonomy
        Map showing approximate distribution of leopard subspecies Felis pardus
        was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.[9] The
        generic name Panthera was first used by Lorenz Oken in 1816, who
        included all the known spotted cats into this group.[10] Oken's
        classification was not widely accepted, and Felis or Leopardus was used
        as the generic name until the early 20th century.[11] The leopard was
        designated as the type species of Panthera by Joel Asaph Allen in
        1902.[12] In 1917, Reginald Innes Pocock also subordinated the tiger (P.
        tigris), lion (P. leo), and jaguar (P. onca) to Panthera.[13][14] Living
        subspecies Following Linnaeus' first description, 27 leopard subspecies
        were proposed by naturalists between 1794 and 1956. Since 1996, only
        eight subspecies have been considered valid on the basis of
        mitochondrial analysis.[15] Later analysis revealed a ninth valid
        subspecies, the Arabian leopard.[16]
