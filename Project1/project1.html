        <p>The world’s most-viewed Instagram reel, surpassing a staggering 554 million views, belongs to Muhammad Rizwan, a talented freestyle football player from Kerala, India. This milestone, recognized by the Guinness World Records, puts him in a league of his own, with his reel garnering more views than the combined populations of Germany, Spain, and France.</p>
        <p>The record-breaking reel, posted in November 2023, showcases Rizwan at the Keralamkundu Waterfall in Malappuram. The clip features a seemingly simple yet awe-inspiring stunt. Rizwan kicks a football with precision from a distance, sending it soaring behind the waterfall’s rocks a moment that left even him visibly astonished. Speaking about the experience, Rizwan shared, <q>I never expected this. It was just a fun video with friends. Within 10 minutes, it had 200,000 views, and by the time I got home it hot a million views</q></p>
        <p>Since then, the reel has exploded in popularity, amassing over 92 lakh (9.2 million) likes and more than 42,000 comments. Football enthusiasts and casual viewers alike have praised the video’s creativity and simplicity.</p>

        <h2>Kerala samadhi case: Self-styled guru’s body found in sitting position and covered in ash, police say</h2>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QXI9HZlxl0?si=nnUzUe5GcO-U9INm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>The mystery behind the death of self-styled spiritual guru Gopan Swami was a step closer to being solved on Thursday after his body was exhumed from a concrete chamber in the premises of his house in Thiruvananthapuram and a postmortem was conducted.</p>
        <p>Neyyartinkara Assistant Superintendent of Police S Shaji said a final conclusion on whether the 69-year-old died of natural causes would be arrived at after getting reports on chemical analysis, visceral examination, and histopathology. "There were no external injuries on the body. After the postmortem, the body was handed over to family, the ACP said.</p>
        <p>Police said the body was found in a sitting position inside the chamber and was covered with ash.</p>
        <p>Several people at Aralamudu in the Neyyattinkara area of Thiruvananthapuram have been curious about Gopan's whereabouts since last Friday. His family claimed that he sat in samadhi a state of meditative consciousness, according to different Indian religious traditions- the previous day and was lowered into the concrete chamber that Gopan himself had constructed five years ago.</p>
        <p>After local residents moved a complaint about the mysterious disappearance of their neighbour, police registered a missing person's case and began a probe last Saturday. On the assumption that Gopan's body had been kept in the chamber, erected close to their family temple, the police had made elaborate preparations to exhume the body for postmortem.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Gopan's wife Sulochana, and sons Rajasenan and Sanandan, objected when the police, armed with an order from the Revenue Divisional Officer, tried to open the tomb to exhume the body.</p>
        <p>However, on Wednesday, the Kerala High Court rejected the plea of Gopan's family against the police's move to exhume the body</p>
        <p>Vishnupuram Chandrasekharan, chairman of Vaikunda Swami Dharma Pracharana Sabha (VSDP), a group of the Nadar community said Thursday, <q>We have planned a maha samadhi on Friday which will be attended by several swamis and ashram heads. He died a natural death and the findings go in tune with what his family said. A spiritual guru was insulted and he will be given a maha samadhi. Gopan Swami had attained samadhi, it was made a controversy and history will not pardon those who were involved</q>.</p>

        <p>The Cantonment police in Thiruvananthapuram have booked three journalists working for a leading Malayalam news channel under the provisions of the Protection of Children From the Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.</p>
        <p>The case related to the channel’s coverage of the recently concluded Kerala State School Arts Festival, including interviews and interactions with child participants.</p>
        <p>Stuart Keeler, Assistant Commissioner, Cantonment, confirmed to The Hindu that the police had registered a first information report (FIR) against Arun Kumar, the Consulting Editor of the channel, and his colleague Shabaz. He said the police had not identified the third mediaperson in the alleged offence. </p>
        <p>Mr. Keeler said the police registered the FIR based on specific complaints, including one submitted by a governmental child rights protection agency. </p>
        <p>He said the police had registered the FIR under Sections 11 and 12 of the POCSO Act. The sections relate to the sexual harassment of a child and the broadcast of “any part of the body or involvement of the child” via social or conventional media. These entail a punishment of up to three years of imprisonment and a fine.</p>

        <h2>Kerala doctor booked for blocking ambulance carrying critically ill patient in Kannur</h2>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGkrUN91G8Y?si=LkkSoiDsMmgRe_0e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Kathiroor police have booked a doctor on charges of obstructing an ambulance carrying a critically ill elderly woman in Mattanur, Kannur. The Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) has also imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on the doctor. Dr Rahul Raj was slapped with a fine based on a complaint filed by the ambulance driver, Nellunni native Sarath K, 29. Rahul also faces charges under Sections 285 (causing danger or obstruction in public spaces) and 194E (failing to give way to emergency vehicles) of the Motor Vehicles Act.</p>
        <p>The incident occurred on the evening of January 16 at Nayanar Road, Kathiroor, near Eranholi bridge. Sarath recounted how the patient’s condition worsened after experiencing severe chest pain, prompting her referral from Mattanur Mission Hospital to Indira Gandhi Co-operative Hospital, Thalassery. "Hospital staff recognised the gravity of the situation and sent two personnel with the patient to provide CPR if necessary." The woman was also on oxygen support during the 29-kilometer journey, which Sarath completed in 30 minutes despite heavy traffic.</p>
        <p>Sarath mentioned that the evening rush hour complicated the drive and that the car obstructed the ambulance on three occasions. While he couldn’t confirm if the delay directly impacted the patient’s survival, he stressed the importance of public awareness about the critical role of emergency vehicles. “Every second matters when someone’s life is at stake,” he said.</p>
        <p>The woman, who was being transferred to a hospital in Thalassery after experiencing chest pain, was declared dead just five minutes after arriving at the facility.</p>
        <p>Dr Rahul Raj, whose car caused the obstruction, later explained that he panicked upon noticing the ambulance behind him and was unable to give way due to tension. However, visuals of the ambulance attempting to overtake his car multiple times have gone viral on social media, sparking outrage.</p>
