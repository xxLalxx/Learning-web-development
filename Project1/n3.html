        <p>The case related to the channel’s coverage of the recently concluded Kerala State School Arts Festival, including interviews and interactions with child participants.</p>
        <p>Stuart Keeler, Assistant Commissioner, Cantonment, confirmed to The Hindu that the police had registered a first information report (FIR) against Arun Kumar, the Consulting Editor of the channel, and his colleague Shabaz. He said the police had not identified the third mediaperson in the alleged offence. </p>
        <p>Mr. Keeler said the police registered the FIR based on specific complaints, including one submitted by a governmental child rights protection agency. </p>
        <p>He said the police had registered the FIR under Sections 11 and 12 of the POCSO Act. The sections relate to the sexual harassment of a child and the broadcast of “any part of the body or involvement of the child” via social or conventional media. These entail a punishment of up to three years of imprisonment and a fine.</p>
