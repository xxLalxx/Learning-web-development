        <p>Kathiroor police have booked a doctor on charges of obstructing an ambulance carrying a critically ill elderly woman in Mattanur, Kannur. The Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) has also imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on the doctor. Dr Rahul Raj was slapped with a fine based on a complaint filed by the ambulance driver, Nellunni native Sarath K, 29. Rahul also faces charges under Sections 285 (causing danger or obstruction in public spaces) and 194E (failing to give way to emergency vehicles) of the Motor Vehicles Act.</p>

        <p>The incident occurred on the evening of January 16 at Nayanar Road, Kathiroor, near Eranholi bridge. Sarath recounted how the patient’s condition worsened after experiencing severe chest pain, prompting her referral from Mattanur Mission Hospital to Indira Gandhi Co-operative Hospital, Thalassery. "Hospital staff recognised the gravity of the situation and sent two personnel with the patient to provide CPR if necessary." The woman was also on oxygen support during the 29-kilometer journey, which Sarath completed in 30 minutes despite heavy traffic.</p>
        <p>Sarath mentioned that the evening rush hour complicated the drive and that the car obstructed the ambulance on three occasions. While he couldn’t confirm if the delay directly impacted the patient’s survival, he stressed the importance of public awareness about the critical role of emergency vehicles. “Every second matters when someone’s life is at stake,” he said.</p>
        <p>The woman, who was being transferred to a hospital in Thalassery after experiencing chest pain, was declared dead just five minutes after arriving at the facility.</p>
        <p>Dr Rahul Raj, whose car caused the obstruction, later explained that he panicked upon noticing the ambulance behind him and was unable to give way due to tension. However, visuals of the ambulance attempting to overtake his car multiple times have gone viral on social media, sparking outrage.</p>
